  abstract = {Parameter estimation techniques which fail to adjust for the interim analyses of group sequential test designs will introduce bias in much the same way that the repeated use of single sample hypothesis testing causes inflation of the type one statistical error rate. Methods based on the duality of hypothesis testing and interval estimation require definition of an ordering for the outcome space for the test statistic. In this paper, estimation following a group sequential hypothesis test for the mean of a normal distribution with known variance is investigated. A proposed ordering of the sample space based on the maximum likelihood estimate of the mean is found to result in estimates which compare favourably with estimates computed from orderings investigated by Tsiatis, Rosner \&amp; Mehta (1984) and Chang \&amp; O'Brien (1986) for a variety of group sequential designs. The proposed ordering is then adapted for use when the sizes of groups accrued between analyses is random.},

To evaluate this question, Jeffries and Geller (2015) examined a number of clinical trial designs that allowed adaptive choice of the follow-up time exhibiting the greatest evidence of treatment difference in a group sequential testing setting with Gaussian data. The methods are applicable when a few measurements were taken at prespecified follow-up periods. Here, we test the intersection null hypothesis of no difference at any follow-up time versus the alternative that there is a difference for at least one follow-up time. Results of Jeffries and Geller (2015) are extended by considering a broader range of modeled data and the inclusion of covariates using generalized estimating equations. Testing procedures are developed to determine a set of follow-up times that exhibit a treatment difference that accounts for multiplicity in follow-up times and interim analyses.},

  abstract = {Jeffries et al. (2018) investigated testing for a treatment difference in the setting of a randomized clinical trial with a single outcome measured longitudinally over a series of common follow-up times while adjusting for covariates. That paper examined the null hypothesis of no difference at any follow-up time versus the alternative of a difference for at least one follow-up time. We extend those results here by considering multivariate outcome measurements, where each individual outcome is examined at common follow-up times. We consider the case where there is interest in first testing for a treatment difference in a global function of the outcomes (e.g., weighted average or sum) with subsequent interest in examining the individual outcomes, should the global function show a treatment difference. Testing is conducted for each follow-up time and may be performed in the setting of a group sequential trial. Testing procedures are developed to determine follow-up times for which a global treatment difference exists and which individual combinations of outcome and follow-up time show evidence of a difference while controlling for multiplicity in outcomes, follow-up, and interim analyses. These approaches are examined in a study evaluating the effects of tissue plasminogen activator on longitudinally obtained stroke severity measurements.},

  abstract = {Summary             In longitudinal studies comparing two treatments with a maximum follow-up time there may be interest in examining treatment effects for intermediate follow-up times. One motivation may be to identify the time period with greatest treatment difference when there is a non-monotone treatment effect over time; another motivation may be to make the trial more efficient in terms of time to reach a decision on whether a new treatment is efficacious or not. Here, we test the composite null hypothesis of no difference at any follow-up time versus the alternative that there is a difference at at least one follow-up time. The methods are applicable when a few measurements are taken over time, such as in early longitudinal trials or in ancillary studies. Suppose the test statistic will be used to test the hypothesis of no treatment effect at a fixed follow-up time . In this context a common approach is to perform a pilot study on subjects, and evaluate the treatment effect at the fixed time points and choose as the value of for which is maximized. Having chosen a second trial can be designed. In a setting with group sequential testing we consider several adaptive alternatives to this approach that treat the pilot and second trial as a seamless, combined entity and evaluate Type I error and power characteristics. The adaptive designs we consider typically have improved power over the common, separate trial approach.},
